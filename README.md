# Pimage

Swap every pixel from your favorite .png for a number in Pi!

**Installation on OS X and Linux**

Make sure you have mono-libgdiplus (Mac) or libgdiplus (Linux) installed. Missing this package can cause a program crash that is currently not correctly caught in the code. 

For Mac: 
```
brew install mono-libgdiplus
```

For Linux:
```
apt(-get) install libgdiplus
```

**Usage**

Simply put a file "pimage.png" in the same directory as the executable. Execute and enter desired fontsize, width and height. That's it! 

For Windows: Double click the .exe, no extra steps required.

For Mac and Linux: Change directory in terminal to the same folder as the pimage binary file.

```
/Users/dustin/Downloads/Pimage-main/PimagePiDayProject/Pimage/bin/Release
```
```
./pimage
```
